# Overview

This is a full-stack Finance CRM application built with React, Express, and TypeScript. The system provides comprehensive expense tracking and financial management capabilities with role-based access control. Users can manage expenses, view financial dashboards, and administrators can manage user accounts. The application includes:
- **Advantix Agency Work Reports System** for time tracking and project management with secure role-based permissions
- **Cryptocurrency Management System** for tracking coins, market alerts via Telegram, crypto news with sentiment analysis, and portfolio management using free APIs (CoinGecko, CryptoNews, Telegram Bot)
The application features a modern UI built with shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS for styling.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool
- **Routing**: Client-side routing with Wouter for navigation between pages
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and caching
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS custom properties for theming
- **Authentication**: Client-side auth state management using localStorage

## Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Design**: RESTful API structure with dedicated route handlers
- **Data Layer**: In-memory storage implementation with interface-based design for future database integration
- **Development**: Vite middleware integration for hot reloading in development

## Database Schema
The application uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL schema definitions:

- **Users Table**: Stores user credentials and role-based permissions (dashboard access, expense entry access, admin panel access, crypto access)
- **Expenses Table**: Tracks financial transactions with date, type (income/expense), details, amount, tags, and payment methods
- **Work Reports Table**: Tracks time entries for Advantix Agency work with user assignments, dates, task details, hours worked, approval status, and comments
- **Crypto API Settings Table**: Stores CoinGecko API key, CryptoNews API key, and Telegram bot credentials (bot token, chat ID)
- **Crypto Watchlist Table**: User-specific cryptocurrency watchlist with unique constraint (userId + coinId)
- **Crypto Alerts Table**: Price and percentage change alerts with notification preferences (Telegram/email)
- **Crypto Portfolio Table**: User cryptocurrency holdings with buy prices, quantities, and dates
- **Schema Validation**: Zod schemas for runtime type checking and validation
- **Foreign Key Cascades**: All crypto tables use ON DELETE CASCADE for automatic cleanup when users are deleted

## Authentication & Authorization
- **Simple Authentication**: Username/password based login system
- **Role-Based Access**: Granular permissions system controlling access to different application features
- **Session Management**: Client-side session handling with localStorage persistence
- **Work Reports Security**: Server-side session validation with middleware for work reports API routes
- **Default Admin**: Pre-configured admin user (username: "Admin", password: "Admin")

### Work Reports Security Model
- **Session-based Authentication**: Server-side session validation for work reports routes
- **Role-based Authorization**: Non-admin users can only access their own work reports; admin users can access all reports
- **Authentication Middleware**: Centralized security validation before work reports operations
- **Access Control**: Proper 401/403 HTTP status codes for authentication and authorization failures

### Crypto Access Security Model
- **Permission-based Access**: Users must have `cryptoAccess` permission enabled to access crypto features
- **Session-based Authentication**: Server-side session validation with `requireCryptoAccess` middleware
- **User Data Isolation**: Users can only access their own crypto watchlist, alerts, and portfolio
- **API Key Security**: Crypto API keys stored in database, accessible only to users with crypto access
- **Cascading Deletes**: All user crypto data automatically deleted when user is removed

## Data Storage
- **Current Implementation**: PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM with DatabaseStorage implementation
- **Database Provider**: Replit PostgreSQL database (managed database service)
- **Migration Support**: Database schema management using Drizzle Kit (`npm run db:push`)
- **Connection**: Uses @neondatabase/serverless driver with DATABASE_URL environment variable

## Component Architecture
- **Layout Components**: Reusable header and sidebar components with responsive design
- **Feature Components**: Modular components for expense management, user administration, and dashboard functionality
- **UI Components**: Consistent design system using shadcn/ui components
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form integration with Zod validation
